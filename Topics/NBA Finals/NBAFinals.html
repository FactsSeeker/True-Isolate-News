				<h2>NBA Finals</h2>
				<h3> By: Plop Turkey </h3>
					<p> In a season riddled with injury after injury, the 2021 NBA Finals will see the Phoenix Suns take on the Milwaukee Bucks. The Suns are hoping to win their first ever championship whereas the Bucks hope to win for the first time since 1971. Devin Booker and Chris Paul are leading the charge for the Suns and Giannis ‘The Greek Freak’ Antetokumpo is leading the charge with the Bucks. The Greek Freak is coming off a knee hyperextension from Game 4 in the Eastern Conference Finals the status of his injury is uncertain. 
	        Whatever the result, the outcome of this game will have a tremendous impact on the legacy of many players. If the Suns win, Chris Paul would finally get a ring, something that has eluded him for over a decade. A championship would definitely boost his status as one of the greatest point guards of all time. If the Bucks win, it would be Giannis’ first ring. The Greek Freak is widely regarded as one of the best basketball players in the world already, and a ring would be the first step into cementing himself as one of the all time greats.
	        The first game of the series will take place on July 6th, 2021 at 9 PM. The Bucks will begin the series with a home court advantage but the Suns will have the home court advantage in game 7 (should the series go the distance).
